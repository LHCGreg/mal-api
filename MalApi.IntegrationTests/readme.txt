MAL seems to no longer require an API key.

In order for some tests to pass environmental variables need to be set.
These variable are the username and passowrd of a MAL account.
The requirements towards the account is that it has the 'Cowboy Bebop' anime and the 'Monster' manga added to it.

Steps to set up environmental variables:
1) Follow these instructions to get to the needed window: https://serverfault.com/q/351129 or try searching for 'environment' in the start menu, if you'd like to save those precious seconds.

2) Add two new user variables called 'MAL_USERNAME' and 'MAL_PASSWORD' with the appropriate values for the account you wish to be used with these tests.

3) Done! Go run the tests and see if everything's OK.
